# AlgoSeq
Generative Algorithmic Sequencer

Algoseq is designed as a random sequencer for the Norns with control over scale and algorithm selection.  It is inspired by the Lemur app Breakpoint2, designed and written by Antonio Blanca. 

It is currently a work in progress.  
The current functions that are functioning so far.
- Scale/Mode selection
- MIDI input of root note

Functions to be added
- Algorithm selection
- MIDI Clock input control
- Crow cv/gate output
  - sequencer output
  - gate outs from algorithm
- Crow clock input 
- Visual feedback of algorithm
- Grid/Arc input
- Just Friends/i2c
